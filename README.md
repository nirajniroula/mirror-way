## Mirror Way

MIRROR WAY is a simple 'run on track' game, where the player should draw a tracking line remaining with in the track and with mirror effect. i.e. drawing line on a real track but looking at its reflection.

The project, somehow, is still in progress; there's still place for the things like polishing the UI and working out on collision detection and other minor logical stuffs to make the gameplay better.
